# vue-mixins

A collection of vue mixins to manipulate objects and arrays.<br><br>
The original inspiration for this project was Sarah Drasner's array explorer (https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer). It currently still uses parts of her work as a template.

## W.I.P. / Roadmap status:
```
Status on 30 - 11 - 2019:
Still getting started setting everything up. General plans for this project:
- Section about vanilla javascript array / object manipulation with generalized examples.
- Section about using vue mixins for array / object manipulations, applied to a mock data array.
  * The mock data array consists of 1000 objects, each containing 7 key-value pairs.
- Section about best practices for these vue mixins
