# vue-mixins

## W.I.P. Notes:
```
This is currently pretty much a learn-as-you go project for me. For now, I'm using parts of Sarah Drasner's array explorer (https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer) as an example template for the interface. The intention is to diverge more from her work as more functionality is added.
