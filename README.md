# vue-mixins

A collection of vue mixins to manipulate objects and arrays. The interface was inspired by Sarah Drasner's array explorer (https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer). As this is a learn-as-you-go project for me, it currently still contains unashamed copy-pasted fragments of her code. The intention is to diverge more of Drasner's work as the project continues.
